# Changing-American-Diet (Banana)
The pandemic and Ukraine war propel us to rethink food security and how it is indispensable to prevent wasting food. The Changing American Diet file contains seven datasets and I choose banana for data exploration and modelling. I used pandas library for data exploration and Gradient Boost for modelling. For my concern about wasting food, the key feature is food disappearance per capita in pounds. I performed this project in 2018. However, regarding food insecurity in the world, it is worth considering the project's contribution

# Steps
1-	Load data and data cleaning
Import data, and conduct data wrangling to achieve an ideal dataset.
2-	Investigate on futures and data exploration. 
3-	Data visualization.
4-	Modelling Gradient boost and visualization the result.
